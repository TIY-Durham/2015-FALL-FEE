### Journal, Week 6

Let's see your final _Tutorial_ post completed and reviewed twice. Don't review the work of someone who was on your team, though!

### Shaping Up with Angular JS: Round 3

Continuing with our exercise with Angular JS, work through levels 3 (again) and 4 of _Shaping Up_ on CodeSchool.  Over the weekend, work on levels 4 and 5.  Try to work through the challenges on your own, but don't get bogged down.

### GitHubs Are Forever

Finish up your Responsive GitHub profile. You should have mobile, tablet, and desktop view done.
