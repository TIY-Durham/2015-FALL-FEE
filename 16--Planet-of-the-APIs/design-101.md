# [fit] Design 101
# or:
# How to make your final project not totally ugly

Begun by Caitlin McLeod

## Start with Three Colors:

* Black
* White
* Medium Grey

If you can't design it with these three colors, you can't design it with any colors.

---

# You must
# [fit] EARN THE RIGHT
# to use color.

---

# Don't get too fancy with fonts.

Step 1: Choose **one** font with lots of weights.

Step 2: **Sparingly** use those weights to set content apart.

Step 3: ???

Step 4: **PROFIT!!**

---

#Caitlin's font advice:
- Friendly & Modern: **Lato**.
- Doing something techy? **Source Sans Pro** for regular copy / **Source Code Pro** for code snippets.
- Want to look exactly like Android? **Roboto**.
- Totally set on using a serif font? **Merriweather**.
- Is your all-serif website feeling overwhelming and messy? Swap in **Merriweather Sans** for your headers.

---

# [fit] THOSE FONTS
# [fit] ARE ALL FREE.
# Who doesn't like free stuff?

If you don't like free stuff don't even tell me because I don't want to know.

---

# [fit] Originality is
# [fit] OVERRATED.

This doesn't mean you can go around copying everyone's stuff and calling it your own.

It **does** mean you study common design and interaction patterns that people already know how to use. Do not reinvent interaction patterns.

Adapt styles and structures that work for your needs. But **don't** steal them.

# [fit] Everything we do is for
# [fit] OTHER
# [fit] PEOPLE.

---

## One of the goals of good design is capturing the user's attention.

---

# Attention is the
# [fit] USER'S GIFT
# to you.
### It can be taken away.


---

### Think through your code.

### Think through your designs.

### And use your user stories!

---

# [fit] Also don't ever
# [fit] CENTER
# [fit] paragraphs on a webpage

I'll find you and make you cry.
