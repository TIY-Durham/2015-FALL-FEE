## Hello and welcome to Front End Engineering!

Hi, everyone! I'm David Rogers, and I'm the new Front-End Instructor for the Durham campus. I've been teaching FEE for The Iron Yard since September 2014, when I helped launch the campus in Orlando, and now my family and I are moving to Durham so I can teach here.

Kelly and I are really looking forward to meeting each of you in person and getting to know you better over the course of the upcoming 12 weeks. We're also really excited about teaching and mentoring you all, seeing what awesome things you'll build and what interesting ways you'll approach the assignments and projects in the class.

### Please complete the prep-work below _before class on Monday_...

You should have received a pre-class assignment from Chris, and it's important that you **finish that work before class on Monday.** The assignment that I give isn't significantly different, _but the turn-in instructions are._ They're designed to get you ready for the in-class routine and how _all_ your assignments will be submitted. _Please take the time to complete it!_

First, you need to [sign up for a free GitHub account](http://github.com/signup), **find [the class project](https://github.com/TIY-Durham/2015-FALL-FEE) and "star" it** ([more on "starring" and notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars)). Once you do, I'll invite you to [a group for our class](https://github.com/orgs/TIY-Durham/teams/2015-fall-fee), so watch for an email from GitHub!

Afterward, please take some time to **perform the few additional steps in [the prep-work assignment: `00 -- Ready Player One`](https://github.com/TIY-Durham/2015-FALL-FEE/blob/master/00--Ready-Player-One)**. You may have already done this, if you've completed the assignment that Chris gave you; this important step will create a "flag in the sand" for us to discuss GitHub on Monday. _Please put that flag in the sand for us!_

Next, get acquainted by poking around a bit, _paying special attention to [the class wiki](https://github.com/TIY-Durham/2015-FALL-FEE/wiki)_. There's some important information there about how to turn in assignments, how we'll grade them, and rules of conduct for the class. Throughout the course, I'll be adding files to the repository to distribute assignments, notes for each class, and general information about the course. You'll open, close, and contribute to Issues and Pull Requests ([more about "issues" on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues)) to turn in assignments and show your work.  By the end, you'll all be GitHub experts!

I know there's not a lot of time before class starts; Kelly and I are working hard to get everything ready for you. I can't wait...
