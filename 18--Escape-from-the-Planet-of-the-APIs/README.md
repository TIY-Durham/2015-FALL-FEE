### Journal Week 4

You know the drill: reflective entry draft, tutorial entry draft, 2x :+1: for each. You got this.

### Reading APIs

Here's your next batch of questions for the Github API, which you'll need for the last leg of our Github Revolution:

* How can I use the Github API to...
  * get all the comments for a particular issue?
  * add a comment to an issue?

And since libraries like jQuery and Lodash have feelings... I mean _APIs_, too, read through some of the documentation to answer these questions:

* How can I use [the jQuery API](http://api.jquery.com) to...
    * get the HTML contents of an element?
    * create a _new_ HTML element?
    * add an HTML element to the page?
* How can I use [the Lodash API](http://lodash.com/docs/) to...
  * replace placeholders with values from an object?
  * repeat code for every item of an array?
