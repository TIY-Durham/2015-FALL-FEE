### HALFTIME Journal

#### Three's Company

How're those drafts going? Get a final draft done for your reflection and resource entries, then keep working on your tutorial. Make sure you get those 2 :+1:s and give 2 :+1:s!

#### Build It Out

Not really a _writing_ assignment, per se... Let's make that `USERNAME.github.io` repo into a _real_ blog site. We'll have to do a little remodeling, and you're gonna need some paint.

#### Remodeling

Create a new branch called `release--0.0.2` from `master`. Check out that branch and do this initial work in there, committing after every step. Open a PR and put your **HALFTIME Journal** checklist in the description.

1. Move all your old journal entries and tutorials into a new directory called `_posts/`; stash your in-progress journal entries in `_drafts/`.
1. Use your `init` commands to create `bower.json` and `package.json` files if you haven't already.
1. Add a `npm start` task to `package.json`.

Now that you've got those yaks shaved, it's time to start on the remodeling. Pick one of your features -- the navigation bar, one of the post blocks, the sidebar -- and create a branch _based on `release-0.0.2`_ called `feature/FEATURE-NAME` where `FEATURE-NAME` describes the part you're working on, e.g. `feature/sidebar` or `feature/main-column`.

Commit often while you work, and open a PR _into `release-0.0.2`_ as soon as you can. When you finish a feature, i.e. you complete your checklist, solicit peer review of your work and merge it. If you get stuck on a part of a feature, work on another one. Don't be afraid of having multiple branches open at once; you'll regularly have multiple "in-progress" branches on a team.

### Two is Better Than One

You've met four of the Blueprints so far: `MultiColumnForm`, `NestedAccordion`, `VerticalTimeline`, and  `ViewModeSwitch`. But there's others out there, too, and it's time to meet them -- in a pair.

**The $ Menu**
* [Horizontal Drop-Down Menu](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/03/05/horizontal-drop-down-menu/)
* [Horizontal Slide-Out Menu](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/05/17/horizontal-slide-out-menu/)

**McGriddles**
* [Responsive Icon Grid](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/07/01/responsive-icon-grid/)
* [Responsive Full Width Grid](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/04/17/responsive-full-width-grid/)

Create a branch called `release-0.0.0` in your `TIY-Assignments` repo and get to shaving those yaks. Start with H5BP, Bower and NPM. Tell `git` to ignore the package folders. Write your plan down for each project in a separate issue in your repo and plan out your features. Checklists are encouraged. All of your tools are at your disposal.

Together, craft your basic layouts for both projects. Get the MF'ing HTML up and some basic SCSS. 

#### BEAST MODE

Not enough for you? Then try one of these on for size: [Quotes Rotator](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/03/29/quotes-rotator/) or [Full Width Image Slider](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/02/26/full-width-image-slider/). You'll need all your skills so far to complete this Blueprint .
