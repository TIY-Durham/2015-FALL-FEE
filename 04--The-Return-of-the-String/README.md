### Reading JavaScript: Arrays

Add 10 more entries to your tutorial tonight, specifically including the `Array` type, our first container. Include [the literal `Array` syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), an explanation of [the "magic" `length` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length), and at least [2 `Array` methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Methods_2) that are _not experimental_ (i.e. standard). Use the format below to describe the methods:

### Coding Kata: ROT13

So you like word games, do you? Well, here's something for all the Swedish nerds to love. What if I took the word "hello" and traded every character for the next character in the alphabet? I'd have "ifmmp", which doesn't look anything like "hello" anymore, and represents a "rotated" version of the original word. But why stop at _just the next letter_ when there are _so many_ letters in the English alphabet?

[The ROT13 cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) is a simple extension of this idea: rotate every character in every word by _13_ places, excluding spaces. For example, here's a common printing phrase with ROT13 encoding:

> The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog
> Gur Dhvpx Oebja Sbk Whzcf Bire Gur Ynml Qbt

Since the English alphabet has exactly 26 characters, what happens if you ROT13 an already rotated phrase? Well, you'll find out soon enough! The **Starting Point** below uses `console.assert` for tests, but go **BEAST** by translating to `chai.assert` or `chai.expect`. Either way, you'll want to give yourself some more test cases than you're provided.

Hey, while you're learning about all this rotating stuff, you should finish that `decode` function I started, then refactor `encode` to do the same kind of thing. Pair up, and commit often!

```javascript
/**
 * The function `reverse` computes the reversal 
 * of a given `String` (don't copy-pasta!)
 *
 * @param {String} S to reverse
 * @return {String}
 */
function reverse(S){
    // YOUR CODE HERE: NO INTERNET COPY-PASTA!
}

console.assert(reverse("") === ""); // Really?

console.assert(reverse("A") === "A"); // Jerk.

console.assert(reverse("cat") === "tac");

console.assert(reverse("ward") === "draw");

console.assert(reverse("books") === "skoob"); // Rokey, dokey...

console.assert(
  reverse("we don't want no trouble") === "elbuort on tnaw t'nod ew"
);

/**
 * Function `encode` accepts a `String` and produces
 * the appropriate ROT13 "encoded" version, i.e. every
 * character in `phrase` is "rotated" ahead by 13 characters.
 *
 * @see String.prototype.charCodeAt
 * @see String.prototype.fromCharCode
 * @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13
 * 
 * // Start with just `phrase`...
 * @param {String} phrase to encode
 * // Add `N` in part 2!
 * // @param {Number} N rotation to apply, default 13
 * @return {String} encoded with ROT13
 */
function encode(phrase/*, N */){
    // YOUR CODE HERE... EMPHASIS ON **YOUR**
}

/**
 * Function `decode` accepts a `phrase` and `N` and
 * decoded it appropriately, i.e. every _word_ character
 * in `phrase` is rotated backward by `N` characters.
 *
 * @param {String} phrase to decode
 * @param {Number} N rotation to apply, default 13
 * @return {String} decoded by ROT-N
 */
function decode(phrase, N){
    // YOUR CODE HERE
}

// Produce more examples, please...
console.assert(encode("hello") === "uryyb");
console.assert(encode("uryyb") === "hello");

console.assert(encode("hello", 2) === "jgnnq")
console.assert(decode("jgnnq", 2) === "hello")
```

### Coding Kata: 3s and 5s

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) (pronounced "oiler") has a plethora of problems to solve, many of which requiring all that looping and branching logic we've been chatting about. One problem -- Problem Number 1, in fact -- goes something like this:

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> 
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Woah. That was a jump.

This is an exercise in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems that can more easily be tackled. Pairing up on those problems can also be helpful, so use our pairing rules to guide your time.

#### Starting Point

```javascript
var test = require('mocha').it,
    expect = require('chai').expect, // Use `expect(X).to.be` et al
    assert = require('chai').assert;  // OR use `assert.equal` etc

test('getting a list of multiples of 3', function(){
  // Now what should go in here?
}); // END test 3s
```

### Coding Kata: Even Fibonacci

Here's another gem from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), this time dealing with [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
> 
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
> 
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4 million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
> - [Project Euler No. 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

You read that right: _4 million_. That Euler fella don't play. You'll want to break this problem down a little, I think. In the **Starting Point** below, I've given you some smaller tests and a few infuriating typos for you to fix. Have fun!

#### Starting Point

```javascript
var text = require('mocha').it,
  expects = require('chai').expect;

test('generating the Fibonacci sequence', function(){
  expect(fibonacci(0)).to.deep.equal([ ]);
  expect(fibonacci(1)).to.deep.equal([ 1 ]);
  expect(fibonacci(2)).to.deep.equal([ 1, 2 ]);
  expect(fibonacci(5)).to.deep.equal([1, 2, 3, 5 ]);
  // ...ad nauseum.
}); // END test(fibonacci)

// Hey, where's `fibonacci`...? Uh oh...

test('just even numbers?', function(){
  expect(evens([ ]).to.deep.equal([ ]);
  expect(evens([ 1 ]).to.deep.equal([ ]);
  expect(evens([ 1, 1, 1 ]).to.deep.equal([ ]);
  expect(evens([ 2 ]).to.deep.equal([ 2 ]);
  expect(evens([ 1, 2 ]).to.deep.equal([ 2 ]);
  // More tests, perhaps?
}); // END test(evens)

test('summing lists of Number', function(){
  assert.equal(sum([ ]), 0);
  assert.equal(sum([ 1 ]), 1);
  assert.equal(sum([ 1, 1 ]), 2);
  // ...et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
}); // END test(sum)

// You expect me to write `sum`, too?

test('summing even Fibonacci numbers?', function(){ 
  expect( sum(evens(fibonacci(0))) ).to.equal(FILL_ME_IN); // nice.
  // There really should be more code in here...
}); // END test(dat CHAIN tho)
```

### API Gymnastics: Etsy Products

Quite frequently in the world of programming, we sift through buckets of data looking for some important piece or maybe just some mathematically-derived facts. A little [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) goes a _long_ way in this business. Frequently, our starting data comes from a web service that speaks [a sort of truncated JavaScript syntax called JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

For example, check out [`items.json`](items.json), which contains some data taken from [the Etsy.com API](https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/getting_started/api_basics). We'll use the API directly _much later_ in the class, but for now, make use of [the built-in `Array` methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Methods_2) to answer a few questions about the data. The value of this exercise isn't in figuring out the answer, it's about figuring out _how_ to get the answer.

* What is the total number of items?
* What is the average price of all the items?
* What items cost between $14 and $18 dollars? What are their names?
* What is the name and price of the only item with a `GBP` currency code?
* What are the names of all the items made of wood?
* What are the names of the items that are made of 8 or more materials?
* How many items were made by their sellers?

#### Starting Point -- `TIY-Assignments/APIGymnastics/Etsy.js`

```javascript
// Put `items.json` in your `APIGymnastics` directory...
var items = require('items.json');

// TODO: Setup mocha and chai...

test('this is the easy one', function(){
  expect(Array.isArray(items)).to.be.true; // What.
  // see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray

  expect(items.length).to.equal(FILL_ME_IN); // It's haunting me now...
});

test('finding the average price', function(){
  var yourAnswer = "start with `items`; use `Array` methods";

  expect(yourAnswer).to.be.closeTo(23.63, 0.01);
});

test('finding that perfect $15 item', function(){
  /**
   * @param {Array} items to search through
   * @return {Array} of `items` with `price` between `min` and `max` USD
   */
  function pricedBetween(items, min, max){
    // Just a suggestion, really...
  }

  expect( pricedBetween(items, 14, 18) ).to.deep.equal([
    // Can you find their names _without_ code first?
  ]);
});

test('pond hopping', function(){
  expect( /* your answer */ ).to.deep.equal({
    name: "1970s Schlitz Malt Liquor Glass Beer Pitcher",
    price: 18.00
  });
});

test('just wood or _reclaimed_ wood?', function(){
  var actual = wooden(items); // Who defined `wooden`...? Oh.

  expect( actual ).to.deep.equal( /* an Array of String names... */ );
});

test('this is just SEO bait, I know it...', function(){
  var actual = octomatter(items); // Just one way to do it... Plus, "octomatter"!

  expect(actual).to.deep.equal(/* Look, I can't do _everything_ for you! */);
});

test('true craftsmen... women... people. Birds?', function(){
  expect(makerSellers(items)).to.equal(18);
});
```
