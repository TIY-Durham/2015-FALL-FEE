    "title": "NEW Dragon Beer Mug Greek Rhyton Drinking Horn Style Original Design Handcrafted Stoneware Sci-Fi/Fantasy Art  for Renaissance, Unique Gift",
    "description": "My newest original dragon design is a sculptural drinking vessel made of stoneware clay, food safe glazes -- craftsmanship and quality guaranteed!  Inspired by classic Greek rhytons that were used for drinking as well as ritual use and were often made in the form of animals&#39; heads.  It is a great mug to add to your Renaissance Festival Costume, Celebrations, Feasts, Role Play Games or just for enjoying your favorite beverage in style.  It makes a unique gift for your favorite unique people who are into sci-fi or fantasy.\r\n\r\nThis mug is made to be used!  It is cast from my own molds in durable stoneware clay  and finished with food safe glazes that are fine for ANY beverage, hot or cold.  This dense clay offers the advantage of being able to hold the temperature of your drink longer than other natural materials.  You can chill your mug in the freezer for frosty drinks on hot summer afternoons!  It can also be pre-heated with hot water from the tap or kettle for coffee, tea, hot toddies, wassail or other cozy drinks.\r\n\r\nAll my work is my own original art work and design.  Each piece is handcrafted start to finish in my own studio. I cast my own molds of the work so it can be reproduced by means of slip casting.  I use the highest quality materials and fire to 2180 degrees Fahrenheit for a tough, durable finished product.",

    "title": "Medium Size, Welcome To Our Firepit-Where Friends And Marshmallows Get Toasted At The Same Time-Painted Wood Sign-Custom Colors",
    "description": "This is a solid wood sign that measures 9 1/2&quot; X 18&quot; X 3/4&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe sign reads, &quot;Welcome to our FIREPIT--where friends and marshmallows get toasted at the same time.\r\n\r\nI also have this in a larger 12&quot; X 18&quot; version:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/184513480/welcome-to-our-firepit-where-friends-and?ref=shop_home_active_4\r\n\r\nI also carry a square version with a different &quot;Firepit&quot; saying:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/185299786/welcome-to-our-firepit-where-the-fires?ref=shop_home_active_3\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sign shown has been painted BLACK. The letters have been stenciled with WARM WHITE and KHAKI TAN. The fire is a combination of different shades of YELLOW and ORANGE. I have sanded the sides and edges for a distressed look.\r\n\r\nIt has been sealed with 2 coats of satin poly sealer for added durability. We have added a sawtooth hanger on the back for hanging.\r\n\r\nIf you would like a different color combination please choose from the color chart above and leave your choice in the &quot;Note to Seller&quot; at checkout. Please be specific about the details of what you would like and you are also welcome to contact me with the &quot;Contact Seller&quot; button if you need any help. \r\n\r\n***I can also change the title to &quot;Welcome to our Campfire&quot;. Just let me know when you order that you would rather have &quot;Campfire&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of our signs are handmade by my husband and myself. We use only premium quality 3/4&quot; furniture grade plywood for our signs. We have found this to work better than using pine. It will not warp as pine sometimes will do. Also, there are NO KNOTS in our wood. You will still have natural wood grain and imperfections because it is natural wood, but there will not be any knots in the middle of your sign. I find it makes a much nicer sign for this reason!!!\r\n\r\n***All signs are hand painted. No vinyl lettering is used. Everything is completely hand painted.\r\n\r\nPlease allow 7-10 days for production of your sign. Because they are all individually painted, sanded and sealed....no 2 will ever be alike!\r\n\r\n\r\nI am adding new signs daily so please continue to check back!\r\n\r\nThank you for shopping with Southern Xpressions!!!!",

Sandblasting produces a deep, even mark, and it allows for complete design flexibility. It produces the finest result of all the available engraving methods. \r\n\r\n​\r\nHow does sandblasting work?\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n​\r\nIn sandblasting, an individual vinyl cut image or film mask is made and hand applied to each glass. The negative space is then blasted in a cabinet by a high pressure stream of air and abrasive. The positive space of the vinyl or mask protects the glass areas that will remain clear, while the abrasive carves away the glass in the areas to be engraved. The result is an artistic expression on the glass.\r\n​\r\nWill the engraving be permanent?\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n​\r\nAbsolutely. It is carved into the glass. Unlike screen printed glasses, the engraving will never wash, chip, or wear off. Yes you can even put your glasses in the dishwasher.",

    "title": "Bike Beer Growler Holder Cover Carrier - Bicycle Mounted",
    "description": "Leather beer growler carrier  for your bicycle.\r\n\r\nSo you need to make a trip to your local brewery to fill your beer growler with your favorite craft brew to go enjoy at home, the park, a party, wherever. What better way to make that trip than on your bike and what better way to carry that beer growler than with a hand crafted, classy, stylish leather beer growler holder fixed securely to your bike. This growler holder looks so good that I often attract attention and get compliments from people who don&#39;t even know what a beer growler is, and when I tell them what it is they like it even more.\r\n\r\nThis holder is sturdy and durable,  I just &quot;tested&quot; it on a recent trip from Seattle to San Francisco. It came with me and my bike riding down the coast in the sun, rain and fog. (The first image is actually from half way through the trip and as you can see still looks beautiful after 500 long miles on the road.) Stopping at nearly every brewery along the west coast that we passed it held up remarkably. My riding friend and I were a hit when we showed up at each hiker biker site with a full growler of the local micro brew of the day.\r\n\r\nHand crafted with as much care as the wonderful craft beer that fills your beer growler. Great for transporting your home brew in style or standing out and looking classy when you take that growler to be filled at your local brewery. This growler cover will attract attention and protect your growler at the same time.\r\n\r\nHand crafted out of thick veg-tanned genuine leather to help protect your glass growler. Makes transporting your beer and growler safer, easier and much more attractive. Top simply slides over and snaps shut securing your growler leaving the handle exposed for easy carrying. With the Pedal Happy Leather Growler Cover you now have a stylish classy growler.\r\n\r\nLeather color options - Black, light brown, dark brown or mahogany.\r\n\r\n*growler sold separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECT TESTIMONIALS:\r\n&quot;I like EVERYTHING about this item. If you like beer and like bicycles you&#39;ll be drooling over it. Leather work is top notch!!! I couldn&#39;t be happier!&quot;\r\n- Jeremey\r\n\r\n&quot;Fantastic! I am beyond thrilled w/ the workmanship. Thank you.&quot;\r\n- Claire\r\n\r\n&quot;The craftsmanship is impeccable. So gorgeous!&quot;\r\n- Mandy\r\n\r\n&quot;Beautiful and well made.

    "title": "1970s PBR Glass Beer Pitcher Pabst",
    "description": "This is a large glass pitcher that was used in a Wisconsin bar for years made by Pabst. We believe it is from the late 1960s or early 1970s. It is in very good shape with no chips or cracks (please see pictures) and still displays well.  It measures 9 inches tall & about 6 inches wide. It is made of cardboard and will be shipped in a protective sleeve. It would look great on your bar and it is the perfect gift for a PBR fan. \n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION: We usually ship in 2-3 days of getting a cleared payment. Tracking is included in our shipping price. If the shipping turns out to be cheaper than what we quoted you... we will refund the difference. We also offer free local pick-up... in most situations. Please ask about this if you are interested. We ship almost exclusively through the USPS, since they seem to have the best rates. If you need another shipping company, please let us know.\r\n\r\nInternational Shipping:\r\nDue to the new (higher) shipping prices, please ask us about all international shipping first.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Import Duties, Taxes and Surcharges... these are NOT included in the item price or shipping charges. These charges are the buyer&#39;s responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe will not mark &quot;gift&quot; on the customs form, so please do not ask us to.\r\n\r\nWe will try to find you the cheapest shipping that still has tracking information, but sometimes these estimates are high. It is not unusual for us to have to refund some shipping due to these high estimates.",
