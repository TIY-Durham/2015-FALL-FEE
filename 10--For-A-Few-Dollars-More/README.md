### Journal, Week 2

You should be working on your Final Draft (in a couple revisions) for tomorrow. Make sure you have some peers review your work and get your 2x :+1: ...and some extra eyes to pick out spelling and grammar mistakes! While you're reviewing the work of others, thoughtfully reflect on their journal and leave them a positive comment, a potential improvement or constructive criticism, and a **tl;dr** summary on their PR, even if someone else has already written something. You need _at least_ 2x :+1:'s... don't settle for the minimum.

### Reading CSS

Tonight, focus on the typographic elements of CSS: `font-*`, `text-*`, `line-*`, and don't forget `color`! Pay special attention to the units that you can employ when defining rules for `font-size` or `line-height` and document what the percentage values are relative to.

As you encounter CSS properties in the assignments that you _haven't_ documented yet, add them to your documentation file... even if it's just a flag in the sand. If you're running into them, though, chances are you'll need to know what they do soon enough.

### Laying the Blueprints

#### Nested Accordions

First, time for some more house cleaning. Comment out the link to your `styles.css` from your `index.html` and replace it three more: `mobile.css`, `tablet.css`, and `desktop.css`. Wait, how can you link to three different `.css` files...?

Once you've got that figured out, create the files for `mobile.css`, `tablet.css`, and `desktop.css`. Hmmmm, what could those names mean? Responsive web design! You'll be creating the css for mobile, tablet, and desktop views of the same Nested Accordions site.

Like always, take baby steps with this. First, shrink the browser window to the "mobile" view and make sure you Skritch it. Now, decide what elements need to be in place to create that view. What pesky media queries might you need to get that layout? What about positioning? Sizing? **Note:** While working in the mobile view, you'll want to comment out your `tablet.css` and `desktop.css` views so you don't accidentally overwrite your `mobile.css` styles. Commit your work to GitHub early and often!! 

Once mobile view is set, move on to `tablet.css`, then `desktop.css`. Again, take it slow. First, Skritch the view you're working on. Then, comment out the other two stylesheets.

In addition, if you didn't complete last night's Beast Mode, it's time to do that. If you've forgotten, here's a refresher. Those arrows to the left of the title? Strange magic. How can you replicate that weird twitching they do whenever your mouse gets close? You'll need to learn something about `:hover` states to make the colors change, and you'll need to discover the power of the `::before` pseudo-element to make the arrows work.

#### Multicolumn Form

#### Vertical Timeline

#### View Mode Switch
