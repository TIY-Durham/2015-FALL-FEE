### Journal, Week 2

You should be working on your Final Draft (in a couple revisions) for tomorrow. Make sure you have some peers review your work and get your 2x :+1: ...and some extra eyes to pick out spelling and grammar mistakes! While you're reviewing the work of others, thoughtfully reflect on their journal and leave them a positive comment, a potential improvement or constructive criticism, and a **tl;dr** summary on their PR, even if someone else has already written something. You need _at least_ 2x :+1:'s... don't settle for the minimum.

### Reading CSS

Tonight, focus on the typographic elements of CSS: `font-*`, `text-*`, `line-*`, and don't forget `color`! Pay special attention to the units that you can employ when defining rules for `font-size` or `line-height` and document what the percentage values are relative to.

#### BEAST MODE

As you encounter CSS properties in the assignments that you _haven't_ documented yet, add them to your documentation file... even if it's just a flag in the sand. If you're running into them, though, chances are you'll need to know what they do soon enough.
