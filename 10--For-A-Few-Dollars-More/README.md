### Journal, Week 2

You should be working on your Final Draft (in a couple revisions) for tomorrow. Make sure you have some peers review your work and get your 2x :+1: ...and some extra eyes to pick out spelling and grammar mistakes! While you're reviewing the work of others, thoughtfully reflect on their journal and leave them a positive comment, a potential improvement or constructive criticism, and a **tl;dr** summary on their PR, even if someone else has already written something. You need _at least_ 2x :+1:'s... don't settle for the minimum.
