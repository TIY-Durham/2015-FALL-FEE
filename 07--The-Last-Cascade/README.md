### Reading JavaScript: Events

The `Element.addEventListener` method isn't just limited to `click` events. Pretty much any input a user can provide triggers an event in JavaScript: clicks, scrolls, pressing a key on the keyboard. [The Event Reference in the MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) provides an exhaustive list of events that JavaScript recognizes. Document [the `Event` type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) and answer the following questions about them:

* How does an `Event` "bubble"? Can I make it stop?
* What does the `target` property of an `Event` refer to?
* Besides `click`, what _other_ event types can I trigger with my mouse?
* What types of events can be triggered on a `<form>` element?
