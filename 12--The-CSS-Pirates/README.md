### Journal, Week 3+!

This week, you should produce not one but _two_ journal entries. No worries, because you've got all those ideas backlogged in your `parking-lot.md`, right? (Uh, right?) Yes, but to get _two_ entries out in a week, you'll either have to learn to write faster or learn to write more efficiently. Maybe you need to spend less time drafting or more time planning? Perhaps you should time-box yourself and just release whatever you've written at the end of the timebox? You could always just forget about proofreading and editing... [just write!](http://john.do/today/)

All of the topics from the last three weeks are still fair game. Write _one reflective post_ -- review an event, assignment, or lecture from the last three weeks that includes _lessons learned_ or bright/dim/blocker -- **AND** _one tutorial-style post_ -- explain _one small thing_ to someone who's never seen it before: a tool, trick, or technique you've learned how to use. _Include code!_

If you can't think of what to name your Reflective Journal, `journal-week-3.md` will suffice. Similarly, `tutorial-week-3.md` is a generic name you can use until you have a better one. Start with a quick "flag in the sand" for both: create a file and dump some rough ideas in it.

### Reading HTML: Block vs Inline

Come on, you didn't think that we'd forget, did you? This week is all about writing HTML, so you'll need to use [the HTML section of MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to research and document the tags you'll meet this week in `CheatSheets/HTML.md`. So you don't leave out any important details, use the **Starting Point** provided below. Be sure to identify which [content category](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Flow_content) each element belongs to, the types of permissible content and parents, and document any important attributes. It would also be good to know how these relate to some key CSS properties... like what's included in the **Starting Point**.

You MUST include the following tags in your documentation, and 10 tags in all for tonight:

* `<!DOCTYPE>`
* `<!-- -->`
* `<html>`
* `<head>`
* `<body>`

To start, explain the basic structure of a tag. Include a dissection of the non-word characters used (like brackets, etc), the words inside the brackets, why some tags have other tags in them and how to write them with and without contents. There's a handy pool of examples in [the HTML5 Boilerplate project](http://html5boilerplate.com), so dissect the tags used in `index.html` and `404.html`. For some help with some of the weirdo ones, check out [Conditional Comments on Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_comment).

_There are three attributes that apply universally to all tags._ As you identify them, move them into their own section at the top of your document, as in the **Starting Point**

#### BEAST MODE

Include _all_ the list-describing elements such as `<li>`, `<dt>` and their appropriate siblings and parents. There are only about 6 of them, if you don't count the _experimental_ tags like `<menu>`.

#### NIGHTMARE MODE

Include _all_ [the Interactive Form elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Forms), like `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>` and the rest, noting the differences between `type` attribute values; don't omit `<fieldgroup>` or `<legend>`... They'll come up.

#### Starting Point

```markdown
## `<html>`

the main enchilada, the whole `document`, that which wraps all the others... except for [`<!DOCTYPE>`](#doctype), for some reason.

* _parents_: none, it's the top
* _content_: _only_ [`<head>`](#head) and [`<body>`](#body)
* _display_: `block`, maybe? I mean, I can see it... RESEARCH!

### Attributes

* `class` -- a space-separated list of category names
* . . .

. . .

## `<div>`

A generic page division that should only be used if no other, more semantic choice is appropriate... and because @al-the-x might kill me if I do when I could use [`<section>`](#section) instead.

* _parents_: anything that accepts [Flow Content][1], which is apparently a lot of things.
* _content_: any [Flow Contant][1], palpable content (WTF?)
* _display_: `block`

. . .

### Install-Fest!

This week we'll be learning about and using a few new tools: [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) via [`node-sass`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass),  [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), and [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) via [`generator-h5bp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-h5bp). To save us precious time in class installing them, part of your homework is to burn your own time waiting for things to download _in the background_.

First, open your `TIY-Assignments` repo in Terminal and paste the results of a `pwd` command as a comment in your _WIP Issue_ (use code fences, please). This will help us debug problems later, if you have them. :smiling_imp:

Next, install `node-sass` _globally_ by running `npm install --global node-sass`. This might take a few minutes, depending. When it finishes, paste the output from `which node-sass` into your comments (_inside_ the code fence). Now check out your `package.json`... What's changed? Anything? How would you tell? Explain...

Now you'll need to `npm install --global yo generator-h5bp` and paste the output from `which yo` and `which generator-h5bp` into another comment; include an explanation of what that output tells you about each package. Any changes to your `package.json`? What's going on there?

Finally, these are some well-behaved commands we just installed. Give a little play-by-play on what they do by doing some research and checking out the output of each given the `--help` flag.

### Blueprints: Shaving Private Ryan

You've written the JavaScript for the Blueprints, you've written the CSS for the Blueprints. You know what's coming next, right? The HTML, of course. 

Today, we're only going to focus on two of the Blueprints: Nested Accordion and Multi-Column Form.

#### Nested Accordion

Select all the content in the `index.html` file of `NestedAccordion` and delete it. That's right, wipe it clean. You should be left with a completely blank page. Terrifying! That's ok, we have [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) to help us out.

#### Multi-Column Form

### Would You Like to Play a Game?: Yak-Shaving Chess

For our big project this week, we'll be building a chess-playing application... well, kind of. Start by creating a _new_ repo in Github called `TIY-Chessboard` with a basic `README.md` file and `CC0` license (or whatever, if you have opinions). Read [the doubly-indexed `Array` example from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Creating_a_two-dimensional_array).
