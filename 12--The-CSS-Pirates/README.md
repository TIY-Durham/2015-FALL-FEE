### Journal, Week 3+!

This week, you should produce not one but _two_ journal entries. No worries, because you've got all those ideas backlogged in your `parking-lot.md`, right? (Uh, right?) Yes, but to get _two_ entries out in a week, you'll either have to learn to write faster or learn to write more efficiently. Maybe you need to spend less time drafting or more time planning? Perhaps you should time-box yourself and just release whatever you've written at the end of the timebox? You could always just forget about proofreading and editing... [just write!](http://john.do/today/)

All of the topics from the last three weeks are still fair game. Write _one reflective post_ -- review an event, assignment, or lecture from the last three weeks that includes _lessons learned_ or bright/dim/blocker -- **AND** _one tutorial-style post_ -- explain _one small thing_ to someone who's never seen it before: a tool, trick, or technique you've learned how to use. _Include code!_

If you can't think of what to name your Reflective Journal, `journal-week-3.md` will suffice. Similarly, `tutorial-week-3.md` is a generic name you can use until you have a better one. Start with a quick "flag in the sand" for both: create a file and dump some rough ideas in it.

### Reading HTML: Block vs Inline

Come on, you didn't think that we'd forget, did you? This week is all about writing HTML, so you'll need to use [the HTML section of MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to research and document the tags you'll meet this week in `CheatSheets/HTML.md`. So you don't leave out any important details, use the **Starting Point** provided below. Be sure to identify which [content category](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Flow_content) each element belongs to, the types of permissible content and parents, and document any important attributes. It would also be good to know how these relate to some key CSS properties... like what's included in the **Starting Point**.

You MUST include the following tags in your documentation, and 10 tags in all for tonight:

* `<!DOCTYPE>`
* `<!-- -->`
* `<html>`
* `<head>`
* `<body>`

To start, explain the basic structure of a tag. Include a dissection of the non-word characters used (like brackets, etc), the words inside the brackets, why some tags have other tags in them and how to write them with and without contents. There's a handy pool of examples in [the HTML5 Boilerplate project](http://html5boilerplate.com), so dissect the tags used in `index.html` and `404.html`. For some help with some of the weirdo ones, check out [Conditional Comments on Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_comment).

_There are three attributes that apply universally to all tags._ As you identify them, move them into their own section at the top of your document, as in the **Starting Point**

#### BEAST MODE

Include _all_ the list-describing elements such as `<li>`, `<dt>` and their appropriate siblings and parents. There are only about 6 of them, if you don't count the _experimental_ tags like `<menu>`.

#### NIGHTMARE MODE

Include _all_ [the Interactive Form elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Forms), like `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>` and the rest, noting the differences between `type` attribute values; don't omit `<fieldgroup>` or `<legend>`... They'll come up.

#### Starting Point

```markdown
## `<html>`

the main enchilada, the whole `document`, that which wraps all the others... except for [`<!DOCTYPE>`](#doctype), for some reason.

* _parents_: none, it's the top
* _content_: _only_ [`<head>`](#head) and [`<body>`](#body)
* _display_: `block`, maybe? I mean, I can see it... RESEARCH!

### Attributes

* `class` -- a space-separated list of category names
* . . .

. . .

## `<div>`

A generic page division that should only be used if no other, more semantic choice is appropriate... and because @al-the-x might kill me if I do when I could use [`<section>`](#section) instead.

* _parents_: anything that accepts [Flow Content][1], which is apparently a lot of things.
* _content_: any [Flow Contant][1], palpable content (WTF?)
* _display_: `block`

. . .

### Install-Fest!

This week we'll be learning about and using a few new tools: [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) via [`node-sass`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass),  [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), and [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) via [`generator-h5bp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-h5bp). To save us precious time in class installing them, part of your homework is to burn your own time waiting for things to download _in the background_.

First, open your `TIY-Assignments` repo in Terminal and paste the results of a `pwd` command as a comment in your _WIP Issue_ (use code fences, please). This will help us debug problems later, if you have them. :smiling_imp:

Next, install `node-sass` _globally_ by running `npm install --global node-sass`. This might take a few minutes, depending. When it finishes, paste the output from `which node-sass` into your comments (_inside_ the code fence). Now check out your `package.json`... What's changed? Anything? How would you tell? Explain...

Now you'll need to `npm install --global yo generator-h5bp` and paste the output from `which yo` and `which generator-h5bp` into another comment; include an explanation of what that output tells you about each package. Any changes to your `package.json`? What's going on there?

Finally, these are some well-behaved commands we just installed. Give a little play-by-play on what they do by doing some research and checking out the output of each given the `--help` flag.

### Blueprints: Shaving the Future!

You've written the JavaScript for the Blueprints, you've written the CSS for the Blueprints. You know what's coming next, don't you? The HTML, of course! But in order to write your own HTML, you have to KILL THE HTML you were given! Let's start with **Nested Accordion**...

#### Nested Accordion

Sorry, old boy. Pa's taking you out to the shed. I'll miss you.

Move all your Skitch images into their own folder named `specs/` and commit the change. Then, ruthlessly delete everything else: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the whole thing. *Kablam!*

Start with [a fresh download of HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/releases/download/5.2.0/html5-boilerplate_v5.2.0.zip). What did you get?

#### Multi-Column Form

No need for such a dramatic exit for our next friend. Just import another [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) starting point on top of your existing project. Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be fine! Commit all the updates, and check that `index.html` looks like the "Welcome to HTML5 Boilerplate!" page we'd expect.

#### Vertical Timeline and View Mode Switch

Are you dreading this? No need to worry. These two haven't outlived their usefulness... yet. We'll practice using our new tool, Sass, on these two. Relocate your CSS files from the `css/` directory into a new directory named `scss/`, then rename them to have the `.scss` extension instead of `.css`. For example, `css/styles.css` becomes `scss/styles.scss`.

#### Oh, you thought you were finished?

Now that you've destroyed all your work for the last three weeks... Aww, it sounds so much worse when you say it like that... Anyway, check that it all "works" by running `browser-sync start --server --directory` from the top of your `TIY-Assignments` repository. Man, that's a lot to type. I wish there was a way to make the robot remember that. Pipe dreams! Look at each one of your projects, take a screenshot, and attach the image to your _WIP Issue_. Did everything work like you'd expect? What's missing? What's broke? Explain those wonky screenshots!

### Would You Like to Play a Game?

For our big project this week, we'll be building a chess-playing application... well, kind of. Start by creating a _new_ repo in Github called `TIY-Chessboard` with a basic `README.md` file and `CC0` license (or whatever, if you have opinions). Read [the doubly-indexed `Array` example from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Creating_a_two-dimensional_array), transcribe that into the wiki for your new repo, and _explain_ the following:

* How is that example a _Model_ of a chessboard?
  * What are the representations of the pieces?
  * What attributes of the pieces are represented?
  * What attributes of the board are represented?
* How are moves recorded on the board?
* What should happen when a piece is _captured_?

Next, check out [the Catalan Opening: Closed Variation on Chess.com](http://www.chess.com/opening/eco/E06_Catalan_Opening_Closed_Variation) and Skitch the Game Explorer interface. Store your raw and marked up screens in `specs/` inside your new `TIY-Chessboard` repo. Finally, start brainstorming some User Stories -- A Smurf can smurf so that Smurfs can smurf better -- that describe what interactions you can have _with the Game Explorer interface_. That website is _HUGE_, so focus! Put your draft User Stories in you wiki, as well.

#### BEAST MODE

You've seen the opening, now write down some short-hand explanation of the _moves_ in that opening. What piece moves? Where does it move to? How does that relate to the Model of a chessboard that you've been given?

#### NIGHTMARE MODE

There's [a somewhat famous game between Kasparov and Karpov in 1984](http://www.chess.com/games/view?id=353900) that starts with that opening. Since you're already half-way there... use your short-hand system to enumerate the rest of the moves from that game in your wiki.
