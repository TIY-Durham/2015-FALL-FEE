### Journal, Week 2

Begin the drafting process, like we've done the last two weeks. This time, as you think of topics that are related to your experience last week but that don't fit into your main journal, write them down in a file called `parking-lot.md` and start developing them with bulleted notes, an outline, stream of consciousness or just short rough drafts. You'll need some topics to pick from for next week... maybe even two.

### Reading CSS

Tonight, focus on the [Box Model properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box_model) as we saw them used in class today. Pay careful attention to `box-sizing` and how it changes the math of the rendering model. You should cover the `margin-*`, `padding-*` and `border-*` properties, the `max-*` and `min-*` properties, and `box-sizing` property, at a minimum. All of these properties accept [a numeric length value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) in [various units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#Units) that you should know about. Also pay special attention to [the caveat about inches and DPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#CSS_units_and_dots-per-inch). Computers are hard.

### Githubbing to Know You

Tonight, _try_ to create some merge conflicts: everyone edits _everyone else_. Experiment. Pick different parts of the files to edit and see what conflicts arise. By Thursday, though, _everyone_ should have _everything_ filled out and added to a PR. Let the train wrecks begin!

#### BEAST MODE

Can you _resolve_ all these conflicts and push the resolved code back to Github?
