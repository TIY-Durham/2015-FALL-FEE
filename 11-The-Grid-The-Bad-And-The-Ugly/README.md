### READING ASSIGNMENT?

Do they get a reading assignment on Thursdays?

### Finishing the Blueprints

#### Multicolumn Form

First, verify that you've got your `styles.css`, `mobile.css`, `tablet.css`, and `desktop.css` in your `css` folder of your `MulticolumnForm` folder. Make sure your common styles are in `styles.css`, while your device specific styles are in their respective stylesheets.

Now that everything is in place, it's time to finish `desktop.css`. This is the traditional view, when there are three columns on the screen. You'll need to use all sorts of css magic to achieve this, like `floats` and other positioning elements. As always, use baby steps. How can you create the columns? How can you make them line up so neatly, equal distance apart?

Remember, you're _only_ writing the css that applies to `desktop.css`. All styles shared between the three views should be in `styles.css`. 

Like last night's *Beast Mode*, add commentary to your _WIP Issue_ about the three responsive stylesheets and their shared `styles.css` sibling. How do you think the three CSS files interact? How can they "live in harmony" together?

##### BEAST MODE

Have you heard of the term "pixel perfect" before? Pixel perfect can mean a lot of things, but here we're talking about matching _your_ layout to the original one -- down to the last pixel. For *Beast Mode*, try to emulate the original Multicolumn Form as completely as possible. Consider font face and size, colors, and distances between elements. What tools are at your disposal to help you identify these elements? That's right, time to have a chat with our buddy Dev Tools.

##### NIGHTMARE MODE

There might be giants...giant monitors, that is. (Have you seen the ones in the instructor office?) Do some research on designing for large monitors. How do you write XL media queries? Do you even need to? Create a `xlarge.css` stylesheet and incorporate your newfound knowledge in the styles there.
