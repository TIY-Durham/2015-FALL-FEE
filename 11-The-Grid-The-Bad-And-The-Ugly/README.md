### Finishing the Blueprints

The end is in sight! You've made, built, colored, and planned the blueprints. Time to polish them up! The main concepts you're tackling this weekend is how to apply different styles to the same elements depending on _context_. In **Multi-Column Form** and **Vertical Timeline**, the context is _device-specific_: the browser has to selectively apply certain styles based on specific criteria determined by the size of the viewport. In **View Mode Switch**, the elements contributing to the layout don't change, but the arrangement of them is dependent on criteria altered by JavaScript: the class name of an ancestor.

#### Multi-Column Form

First, verify that you've got your `styles.css`, `mobile.css`, `tablet.css`, and `desktop.css` in the `css` folder of your `MulticolumnForm` folder. Make sure your common styles are in `styles.css`, while your device specific styles are in their respective stylesheets. If you haven't refactored your common styles yet, now is the time to do that.

Now that everything is in place, it's time to finish `desktop.css`. This is the traditional view, when there are three columns on the screen. Use the CSS magic we saw in class today to achieve this: `float`-ing columns inside a self-`clear`-ing row. As always, use baby steps. Which elements represent the columns? How much distance is between them? How can you split that distance equally?

Remember, you're _only_ writing the css that applies to the "desktop" view in `desktop.css`. All styles shared between the three views should be in `styles.css`. Don't try to jump straight to that step, though: red-green-refactor! Finally, there should be _no_ changes to your HTML file; use the HTML you're given to produce the layout.

How can you make these three (nay, four!) stylesheets work together in harmony? If you haven't already, you'll need to research [using Media Queries to constrain the CSS applied to the page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries). In this case, the criteria is the size of the viewport, and the _simplest_ way to apply those criteria to each stylesheet would be to use the `media` attribute of the `<link>` tag... But do as you will!

##### BEAST MODE

Have you heard of the term "pixel perfect" before? Pixel perfect can mean a lot of things, but here we're talking about perfectly matching _your_ layout to the original one -- down to the last pixel.

For BEAST MODE, try to emulate the Reference Implementation as closely as possible. Consider `font-*` properties, colors, and especially the distances around and between the elements. What tools are at your disposal to help you in this endeavor? Surely there's [a Chrome extension that could help](http://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) lying around somewhere...

##### NIGHTMARE MODE

We live in an age of giants... giant monitors, that is. Have you seen the ones in the instructor office? If you're looking for more of a challenge, do some research about targeting _large_ screens. How do you write _that_? Do you even need to? What would **Multi-Column Form** look like on a _giant screen_? Create a `cinema.css` stylesheet and distill your new-found knowledge into styles there. Can you make your site "giant monitor friendly"?

#### Vertical Timeline

Be sure to have those four CSS files in `css/` and linked in `index.html`: `styles.css`, `mobile.css`, `tablet.css` and `desktop.css`. Have you noticed the differences between "desktop" and "tablet" yet? Refactor your `styles.css` to only contain the _common_ styles and put the desktop-specific styles in `desktop.css`. Then, start working on the "mobile" view.

First show us your ["skills of an artist"](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail58.html) and Skitch the mobile view. Now, can you _build_ the mobile view? There's some dark magics involved here. You'll have to add some `max-width` Media Queries and _override_ some styles from `desktop.css` for sure. And what can you do to `font-size` to make it shrink for mobile view?

##### BEAST MODE

Pixel perfect: make your layout match your screenshot of the reference implementation _precisely_. What font faces, sizes, and colors do you need?

#### View Mode Switch

Last night, you should have done your yak-shaving and Skitch-ing. Now it's time to bring this monster to life!

For this layout, let's just focus on the "desktop" view of the bottles in both "grid" and "list" mode.

View Mode Switch has three distinct views, which means four stylesheets: `styles.css` for shared styles, then `mobile.css`, `tablet.css`, and `desktop.css` for their respective views. Make those, and put them in the `css` folder of your `ViewModeSwitch` directory.

Now, focus on the shared styles for `styles.css` and what styles you need for `desktop.css`. Start with the grid. Focus on the selectors and properties you'll need for the _grid layout_ of the site. Hint: you'll need to break into your css toolbox for properties like `max-*`, `min-*`, and pseudo-elements like `::before`, among others. And don't forget the `font-*` properties!

After you've got the grid set, align the text, then the images. Be careful! You might find they pop your grid out of whack. Just keep adjusting until it's back. Don't forget those toggle buttons in the upper-right hand corner, either. Wire them up to your JavaScript!

Now, it's called View Mode _Switch_ for a reason, right? Time to switch that layout to list view! Still working with your `desktop.css` view, build out the list view for the site. You'll need a grid here, too, but with different positioning properties. Wait, if there's a grid view and a list view, how can they share the same css stylesheet...?

Make sure your layout is _squishy_, not static. It shouldn't fall apart when the site gets smaller. 

##### BEAST MODE

In addition to being a cool example of grid layouts, [View Mode Switch](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/ViewModeSwitch/) is a responsive site. Don't believe me? Grab the edge of your browser window and shrink...shrink...shrink some more. Boom! Tablet and mobile views!

For Beast Mode, add reponsiveness to the layout. You might need to change your column numbers, maybe even hide columns for certain views...

##### NIGHTMARE MODE

Pixel perfect _both_ views. Work with your `max-*` and `min-*` properties, as well as `padding-*` and `margin-*` properties. Finish off with stylings, like your typography elements.

### Attack of the Killer TodoMVC

Like a Killer Tomato, ToDoMVC is back. When we last left our intrepid Todo app, you'd created the User Stories for the app in your `TodoMVC/js/app.js` file. This weekend, you're going to build the _first_ User Story.

```javascript
// User Stories
// I can add a task to my todo list so that I can remember to do it later.
```

For NORMAL MODE, you'll need to capture the user input and then `console.log` that input. Take a screenshot of the output and include it in your _WIP Issue_.

Don't be afraid to refine your original User Story. Also spend some time thinking through what you might need to use to implement this task. Think back to _days_ ago and all the useful tricks you've learned like `addEventListener`, as well as fun array methods like `.push`. 

For an extra challenge, consider flexing your newfound [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) muscles for this task.

##### BEAST MODE

You've successfully logged the output in `console.log`. Now you need to log the item..._in the display_. This is one tough tomato.
