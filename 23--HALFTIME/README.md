### Halftime Journal
Final draft for your tutorial! Make sure you get those 2 :+1:s and give 2 :+1:s!

#### Finishing Up the Features
You should be finishing up on your build out, so we can transplant your `_posts/` onto your homepage next week. Prioritize features that directly contribute to the functionality of your site and cut any that don't look feasible any more... at least until your Portfolio week.

Continue working in `feature/*` branches and merging them as you get reviewed by your peers (2x:+1:s!). _Show your work_ for visual inspection and insist on seeing their work, too. Just eyeballing their code isn't good enough...! Also inspect their code for ugly stuff: poor indentation, swathes of commented code, vast tracts of whitespace. Write down your feedback in their PRs. Incorporate the feedback of others.

### Blueprints Everywhere!

Keep working with your partner on your Blueprints, using a similar branching and review process as above. Your branch should be `release--0.0.2`. Be sure to _show your work_ during review!
