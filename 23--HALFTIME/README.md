### Halftime Journal

Final draft for your tutorial! Make sure you get those 2 :+1:s and give 2 :+1:s!

### Finishing Up the Features

You should be finishing up on your build out in `USERNAME.github.io` so that we can transplant your `_posts/` into your homepage next week. Prioritize features that directly contribute to the functionality of your site and cut any that don't look feasible any more... at least until your Portfolio Week (that's lucky 13).

Make branch `release--0.0.3`. Continue working on your features in `feature--*` branches and merging them as you get reviewed by your peers (2x:+1:s!). _Show your work_ for visual inspection and _insist on seeing their work_, too. Just eyeballing the code isn't good enough...! _Also_ inspect the code for ugly stuff: poor indentation, swathes of commented code, vast tracts of whitespace. Write down your feedback in the PR. Incorporate the feedback of others.

### Blueprints Everywhere!

Keep working with your partner on your Blueprints. Your current release branch should be `release--0.0.2`; open a new one every morning over the weekend. _Don't forget to bump the version!_

When you finish one of your Blueprints, or at least add a significant portion of functionality to it, consider bumping the `minor` version instead of the `patch` version. By the end of the weekend, what should your version number be, at least?

#### BEAST MODE

Those **McGriddles**... Oh, those **McGriddles**. So very tedious. So much repetition. And they don't need _any_ JavaScript at all, do they? Can you _invent_ some? Wouldn't it be nice if JavaScript could do all that repetition for you? Maybe instead of kitty pictures, [you could pull some image data from a web service?](https://api.imgur.com/) Perhaps [fetch some cool icons from The Noun Project?](http://api.thenounproject.com/documentation.html#get--collection-%28int-id%29-icons)
